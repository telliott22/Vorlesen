# Feature Specification: Author Proofreading TTS Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a tool that helps authors proof read their work. The user's pain point is that when they are checking their work, they find it hard to spot mistakes as they read the text. They use some text to speech tools online to read their work aloud to them, because they find it easier to spot mistakes when they hear it audibly. However, the tools they use are either limited in how much text can be read aloud, expensive or free but with a very artificial sounding voice. I want to build a simple website where they can copy and paste their story into a text box that accepts as much text as the user wants, they click a button and we make a request to a TTS provider. The user then can either download the file or play it in the browser. I don't want any authentication at this point, I want it to be as simple as possible. I want to use a TTS provider that is low cost but high quality voice. I will provide an API key of whatever service we use. I also want to come up with a catchy name. I want to use Next.js, ShadCN and tailwind. This will be hosted on vercel, so I don't want any backend, everything can hopefully be done with next functions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ User description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Authors writing and proofreading text
   ‚Üí Actions: Paste text, convert to speech, play audio, download audio
   ‚Üí Data: Text content (unlimited length), audio files
   ‚Üí Constraints: No authentication, simple UX, low cost TTS
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific voice(s) should be available - male/female/multiple options?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What audio format for download - MP3/WAV/other?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should audio be streamed for long texts or processed entirely before playback?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to adjust speech rate/pitch/volume?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to audio files after generation - are they persisted or temporary?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there any limits on text length despite "unlimited" - e.g., TTS API limits, file size constraints?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ User scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Requirements generated with clarification markers
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 6 clarification points remain"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What audio format should the system generate for downloads? ‚Üí A: MP3 - widely compatible, smaller file size
- Q: What voice options should be available to users? ‚Üí A: 2-3 preset voices (e.g., male/female) - simple choice
- Q: Should users be able to adjust speech settings (rate, pitch, volume)? ‚Üí A: Playback speed control only (via browser player, no regeneration)
- Q: What happens to generated audio files after creation? ‚Üí A: Browser localStorage persistence (survives page refresh, same device/browser)
- Q: Are there any practical limits on text length? ‚Üí A: Chunked processing with ordered stitching and failure handling

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An author has completed a draft of their story and wants to proofread it for errors. They find it difficult to catch mistakes when reading silently, but easily spot errors when hearing their text read aloud. They visit the website, paste their entire manuscript (which could be thousands of words), and click a button to generate speech. They then listen to their work being read by a natural-sounding voice, either through the browser's audio player or by downloading the audio file to listen on the go. This helps them identify awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and flow issues they would have missed otherwise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an author has written a 5,000-word story, **When** they paste the text into the text input area and click the generate button, **Then** the system converts the entire text to speech and provides playback controls
2. **Given** a text-to-speech audio file has been generated, **When** the user clicks the play button, **Then** the audio plays in the browser with standard playback controls (play, pause, seek)
3. **Given** a text-to-speech audio file has been generated, **When** the user clicks the download button, **Then** the audio file is downloaded to their device for offline listening
4. **Given** a user visits the website for the first time, **When** they view the interface, **Then** they see a clear text input area, a generate button, and simple instructions without any login or signup requirements
5. **Given** a user has pasted text and clicked generate, **When** the conversion is in progress, **Then** they see a loading indicator showing the process is underway

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user submits an empty text field?
- How does the system handle extremely long texts (e.g., 50,000+ words)?
- What happens if the text-to-speech conversion fails?
- Can users generate a new audio file while one is already playing?
- What happens if the user navigates away from the page during audio generation?
- How does the system handle special characters, formatting, or non-standard punctuation in the text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept text input of any length without arbitrary character limits
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a single-click action to convert pasted text into speech audio
- **FR-003**: System MUST use a text-to-speech service that produces natural, high-quality voice output
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to play generated audio directly in the browser
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to download the generated audio file to their device
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a loading state during audio generation
- **FR-007**: System MUST NOT require user authentication or account creation
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle text-to-speech conversion errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide playback controls (play, pause, seek, speed adjustment) for in-browser audio playback
- **FR-010**: System MUST be accessible without requiring users to manage API keys or technical configuration
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide 2-3 preset voice options for users to select from before conversion
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate audio in MP3 format for download
- **FR-013**: System MUST process long texts in chunks to handle API limits, with progress indicators visible to users
- **FR-014**: System MUST NOT regenerate audio for playback speed changes; speed control operates on generated audio only
- **FR-015**: System MUST store generated audio in browser localStorage to persist across page refreshes on the same device/browser
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle TTS provider limits by chunking text and stitching audio chunks in correct order, with retry capability for failed chunks

### Key Entities
- **Text Submission**: The original text content provided by the user; stored temporarily during conversion process; primary attribute is the text string itself
- **Audio File**: The generated speech audio output; contains the converted text-to-speech audio in MP3 format; can be played in-browser or downloaded; persisted in browser localStorage across sessions
- **Conversion Request**: The action of converting text to speech; has states (pending, processing, completed, failed); ties together the input text and output audio
